## Setup
### Hardware
* 1 Raspberry PI

### Software
* 
## Current implementation
### Architecture overview
![Architecture diagram]()
### Rhasspy (Voice assistant)
#### Configuration

### NLU (Rasa)

### TTS / STT

### Handler

### Intent handling

### UI

## Known Issues
* **Security**: while this assistant is meant to be working offline/using a local network, there might be some security concerns. While the hackathon, we assumed the local network the project is running on is correctly protected.

## Future work
Making an amazing product takes time, more time than a hackaton allows.  
You'll find here the ideas we had for the future of the product.

### Hardware
* The project is currently running with a headset for voice input and output. However, this could be changed using a *ReSpeaker* on a *Raspberry PI 3* for the microphone and a simple speaker to hear the bot's answer.
